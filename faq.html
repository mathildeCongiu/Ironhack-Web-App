    <p>Why did you do this website?</p>
    <p>Because some TA forced me to and because I am a Chess player myself</p>
    <p>What is its purpose</p>
    <p> The purpose is to check if you got the save birthday date as a chess Grand Master. It is a funny way to display information about great Chess PLayers. Actually we only know few GM in the world and they are more than 1900</p>
    <p>How does it work?</p>
    <p>Go to Check it page and enter your birthday. The site will display the information of the player that has the same birthday as you</p>
